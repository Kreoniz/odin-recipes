        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard 
            cheese, cured pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern
            form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add 
                guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until 
                evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat 
                and drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti 
                in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet 
                firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the 
                pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black 
                pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Pour egg mixture 
                over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled.
                Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese 
                and more black pepper.
