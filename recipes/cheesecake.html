        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. 
            The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, 
            fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), 
            eggs, and sugar.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>
                4 (8 ounce) packages full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature
            </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar for 
                crust in a bowl until mixture resembles wet sand. Transfer to 
                the prepared pan. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to press 
                crumbs firmly into an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown,
                8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit on a wire 
                rack until completely cool. Leave the oven on.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the crust is cooling, beat cream cheese in a stand mixer 
                fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add sugar, sour cream, and vanilla. Scrape down the bottom and 
                sides of the bowl and continue to beat until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently whisk one egg with a fork in a small bowl; add to the 
                cream cheese mixture and beat just until combined. Repeat with 
                each remaining egg, whisking and adding just one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and firmly bang it on 
                the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the springform pan (with the cooled crust) in an oven 
                bag. Fold down the excess and wrap the pan in a layer of 
                heavy-duty aluminum foil. Pour cheesecake mixture into the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan and move it 
                to the lower rack of the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour 2 inches of boiling water into the roasting pan. Bake 
                cheesecake until edges are puffed and surface is firm except 
                for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan 
                is gently shaken, about 1 ½ hours. Tent the cheesecake with a 
                sheet of foil if the top is browning too much during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off the oven; keep the oven door closed and let the 
                cheesecake cool slowly for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven. Take the springform pan out of the water 
                bath and set it on a cooling rack; let sit until it comes to 
                room temperature, about 2 more hours. Place in the refrigerator
                until fully set, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the pan. Unhinge 
                the lock and remove the pan sides. Use a warm, clean knife to 
                cut every slice. Top slices with cherry pie filling. 
                Keep leftovers in the refrigerator.
            </li>
        </ol>
